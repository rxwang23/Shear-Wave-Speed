# Shear Wave Speed
Calculating shear wave speed from given displacements

Call getGroupVel(arfidata,axial,lat,t, iteration, C1_x); in the 'main file'. The sample 'main file' is 'homogenous.m'.

Load all data into homogenous.m file. Include:
- displacement data (uIntrp)
- lateral data for x axis in meters (xq)
- axial data for y axis in meters (yq)
- time array in seconds (tlist)
